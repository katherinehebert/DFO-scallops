# Scallop fishery trends with DLMtool

This is my 2021 [BIOS2](https://bios2.usherbrooke.ca/) Internship, done with Fisheries and Oceans Canada under the supervision of RÃ©nald Belley from July 22nd to August 13th.

This repository contains the code and other documents to create the summary report describing the data exploration and analysis process of using DLMtool with scallop fishery data. The main findings are described in the [Summary Report](https://github.com/katherinehebert/DFO-scallops/blob/master/SummaryReport.pdf). 

The datasets used in the code and documents are not openly accessible.
